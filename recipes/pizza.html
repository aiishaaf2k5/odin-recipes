        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pizza is a yummy and popular food that many people enjoy. It starts with soft dough that’s rolled out and baked. On top of the dough, there’s tomato sauce, melted cheese, and toppings like pepperoni, mushrooms, or veggies. Everything gets cooked in the oven until the cheese is bubbly and the crust is golden.</p>
        <p>Pizza is fun because you can make it just the way you like. You can use only cheese or add lots of toppings. Some people like it thin and crispy, while others like it thick and soft. No matter how you make it, pizza is tasty and great for sharing with family or friends.</p>
