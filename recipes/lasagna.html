        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a popular Italian dish that’s loved for its tasty layers. It’s made with wide, flat noodles that are stacked with a meat sauce, usually made from ground beef or sausage, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and spices. In between the layers, there’s also creamy ricotta or white sauce, which makes it soft and rich. On top, it’s covered with lots of melted cheese like mozzarella and parmesan, then baked in the oven until it’s hot and golden.</p>
        <p>One of the best things about lasagna is how easy it is to change it to fit different diets. You can make it with vegetables like spinach, mushrooms, or zucchini instead of meat, or even use plant-based options. Each bite has a mix of soft pasta, tasty sauce, and melted cheese, which makes it perfect for family meals or special get-togethers. Lasagna is a warm, filling dish that feels like home.</p>
